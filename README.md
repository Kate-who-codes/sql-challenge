# sql-challenge

Complete a research project on employees database of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

Design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, perform the following:

Data Modeling

Data Engineering

Data Analysis



1. Data Modeling
Inspecting the CSVs and sketching out an ERD of the tables using the app QuickDBD

2. Data Engineering
Using the created diagram from the QuickDBD to create a table  for each of the six CSV files. Remember specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Importing each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.


3.Data Analysis
-- 1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
